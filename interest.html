    <p>
        Conventional: I am not very creative, so if I have a set guidelines, then it easy for me to get started and
        work,
        Investigative: As a coder I have to think of how to solve the problem, then code it and see if it will work,
        Realistic: I don’t agree with this. I’m fine with working with my hands and I don’t mind being outside and
        working outside, I don’t like dealing with plants and animals and wood. I hate paper work and as a coder, Pair
        programming is a lot better than single programming, since 2 heads are better than 1,
        Social: I usually give good advice to people that ask for my help,
        Enterprising: I am not much of a leader and I don’t mind taking some risk, if nobody takes risk than how can
        they grow. I usually act then think about the consequences afterwards,
        Artistic: I have no art skills.

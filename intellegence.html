    <p>
        Linguistic: I do not agree with what I got, because I am not good at writing. I was never good at school and I
        have a small vocabulary list.
        Logical-mathematical: I agree with what I got, because as a coder, we come across many different variety of
        problems and we have to find solutions for the problems.
        Visual-spatial: I do agree with this one, because when we remodel or but a new vase or something, my parents
        usually ask me for my advice of what they think should be placed where.
        Intrapersonal: I’m not sure how I feel about this one. I don’t really know my limits and I am not connected to
        who I am.
        Interpersonal: I do agree with this one, because people usually come to me for advice, for different things.
        Also, when people have an argument I am the judge of who’s right and wrong.
        Musical: I 100% agree with this one. I have no music talent. I tried to learn the piano, but never could and I
        tried to learn the guitar, but never could.
        Bodily-kinesthetic: I do like do figure things out and how they work, and I just learned to pick locks, so I
        ya, I would have to agree with this one as well
        Naturalistic: I am not very sure about this one either, I think I am in the middle of it if I agree or disagree
